Thank you for your time. We continue this series in the next blog.</p>\n","frontmatter":{"slug":"gsoc_0~2_asr_to_wasm_backend","excerpt":"Pre-GSoC 22: Blog 2","title":"The Designing of the ASR->WASM Backend","publishedAt":"2022-06-17","day":"June 17, 2022","readingTime":"2 min read"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
