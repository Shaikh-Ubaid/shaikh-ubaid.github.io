So, the best way forward was to\nimplement a <code>WASM-&gt;WAT</code> backend. More details about this discussion are here <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/-/issues/689\">#689</a>.</p>\n<p>This phase was mostly/approximately from <code>22-05-2022</code> to <code>03-06-2022</code>.</p>\n<p>The MRs during this phase are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/-/merge_requests/1748\">!1748</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/certik/test_wasm/pull/4\">#4</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/certik/test_wasm/pull/5\">#5</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/-/merge_requests/1757\">!1757</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>That's all for this blog.
